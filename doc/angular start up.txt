You use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application 
and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing 
development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.

running the application 

The Angular CLI includes a server, so that you can build and serve your app locally.

Navigate to the workspace folder.

Run the following command: ng serve --open

The ng serve command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.
